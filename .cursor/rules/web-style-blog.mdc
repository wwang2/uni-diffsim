You are implementing a web frontend with an editorial blog aesthetic: calm, typographic, high-signal, zero gimmicks.

NON-NEGOTIABLES (ANTI “AI-SLOP”)
- No neon gradients, glassmorphism, floating blobs, random noise textures, “futuristic” glows, or over-animated UI.
- No meaningless embellishment. Every visual element must carry information, affordance, or hierarchy.
- Avoid “template” vibes: do not dump a component library default theme without re-tokenizing it.

FOUNDATION: TOKENS FIRST
- Define design tokens once; consume everywhere. Prefer CSS variables + a single theme file.
- Required tokens (minimum):
  - color: bg, fg, muted-fg, subtle-border, link, link-hover, selection
  - type: font-sans, font-mono, text sizes (xs/sm/base/lg/xl/2xl), line-heights
  - spacing: 4/8/12/16/24/32/48/64
  - radius: 6/10/14 (avoid 9999 pill unless semantic)
  - shadows: 0–2 steps max (subtle), or none
- Prefer warm-neutral grayscale with one restrained accent color.

LAYOUT & RHYTHM
- Max content width: 68–78ch for prose; avoid ultra-wide text blocks.
- Baseline rhythm: use spacing scale; do not invent one-off values.
- Use generous vertical whitespace; avoid dense “dashboard packing”.
- Use responsive margins/padding with clamp(): preserve rhythm across breakpoints.

TYPOGRAPHY (THIS IS THE PRODUCT)
- Default body: 16–18px with 1.55–1.75 line-height.
- Headings: fewer, clearer levels; strong hierarchy, minimal decoration.
- Avoid trendy fonts; prefer legible system sans or a single tasteful editorial sans + mono for code.
- Links look like links: underlines by default, offset and thickness tuned; hover changes are subtle.
- Use small-caps/overlines sparingly for metadata (date, section).

COLOR, BORDERS, ELEVATION
- Use borders and background tints, not heavy drop shadows, to separate surfaces.
- Border color should be very subtle (close to background) and consistent across components.
- Reduce contrast for tertiary UI; keep primary text high contrast.

COMPONENT STYLE (EXECUTION RULES)
- Buttons:
  - Primary: solid or subtle tinted; no gradients; hover = small contrast shift.
  - Secondary: border + transparent background; hover = faint bg tint.
  - Focus states: visible and consistent (outline + offset), never removed.
- Cards/Sections:
  - Use border + padding + clear title; no “floating shadow stacks”.
  - Prefer dividing lines and section headings over nested boxes.
- Navigation:
  - Minimal; text-forward; current state indicated by weight/underline, not color alone.
- Forms:
  - Labels always present; helper text short; errors precise and actionable.

CODE & TECHNICAL CONTENT PRESENTATION
- Code blocks:
  - Mono font, subtle background, border, horizontal scroll.
  - Show language; allow copy; avoid syntax themes that overpower prose.
- Figures:
  - Captions required; visuals align with text width; no decorative charts.
- Tables:
  - Use for comparisons; zebra only if needed; borders subtle.

MOTION
- Prefer none. If used: 150–220ms, ease-out, opacity/transform only.
- Never animate layout shifts for fun. No parallax. No scroll-jacking.

ACCESSIBILITY
- Keyboard focus always visible.
- Respect reduced-motion.
- Color is never the only signal; ensure link recognition and error semantics.

IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST (WHEN CODING)
- Use tokens; no arbitrary hex values in components (except token definitions).
- Keep components small; styling co-located with component only if it is truly local.
- Prefer semantic HTML + minimal wrappers; typography handled by a single “Prose”/“Article” wrapper.
- Before shipping a page: scan it in grayscale, then in mobile width; hierarchy must still read.
